# Data Visualization Week September 9-13, 2024

Master the art and science of data visualization with Northwestern's top specialists in a series of engaging workshops designed to take your skills from basic to brilliant. Dive into the world of static, dynamic, and interactive visualizations, and explore GIS tools, R, and Python through hands-on sessions. Plus, get personalized guidance on your projects during our daily drop-in office hours with expert advice. Don't miss this opportunity to elevate your data visualization game! 

## Schedule 

The sessions are organized into tracks. From Monday to Thursday, the first track is Mapping (9:30am - 11am), then R (11am - 12:30pm), and then Python (1:30pm - 3pm). Friday will include a "grab bag" of additional resources.  Each day there will be drop-in "office hours" from 3pm - 4pm, where you can get individualized help and feedback on your data visualization projects.

All sessions are in the [North Study Lounge of Mudd Library](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/visit/maps/mudd-library/).

Links to each workshop's GitHub repo are provided below (where available) within the daily schedule.  For more information on each workshop, please see the [PlanitPurple website](https://planitpurple.northwestern.edu/event/618033).
